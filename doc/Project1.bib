Abstract = {This chapter describes a suite of tests, primarily those collectively referred to as Raven's Progressive Matrices. They have been used extensively as operationalizations of intelligence for good or ill. The tests are generally considered to be good measures of eductive or fluid intelligence. The psychometric properties are good, and the tests are easily administered and scored. Raven's tests were developed over a period of years beginning in the 1930s, and a tremendous database has become available. Currently, the tests are used extensively over the world.
